# ðŸ§© autoflux
 
**autoflux** is a cross-platform tool for assembling scripts, commands and automation stuff into a documentable and maintainable fully posix compliant command line interface.

## How does it work?

In **autoflux**, commands are folders containing an index file, called `program.json`, that file will follow a schema that can be used to assemble scripts and commands. To start using the project you just need to create a folder, create the index file and put all the needed files in order to assemble then in a single command line tool.
